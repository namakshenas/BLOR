[KNOWLEDGE]
Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) requires that performance measures or metrics be classified into inputs and outputs. Whether it is the researcher, the practitioner or the student, the use of the DEA methodology gives rise to an important question before proceeding to a DEA analysis: What are the outputs and inputs to be used to characterize the performance of those decision-making units (DMUs)? Executives can study the top-performing units, identify the best practices, and transfer that valuable knowledge throughout the organization to enhance performance.

The resources used or required are usually the “inputs” and the outcomes are the “outputs”. If, however, the DEA problem is a general benchmarking problem, then the inputs are usually the “less-the-better” type of performance measures and the outputs are usually the “more-the-better” type of performance measures.

In general, DEA minimizes “inputs” and maximizes “outputs”; in other words, smaller levels of the former and larger levels of the latter represent better performance or efficiency. This can then be a rule for classifying factors under these two headings. There are, however, exceptions to this; for example, pollutants from a production process are outputs, yet higher levels of these indicate worse performance. There are DEA models that deal with such undesirable outputs.

It is well known that large numbers of inputs and outputs compared to the number of DMUs may diminish the discriminatory power of DEA. A suggested “rule of thumb” is that the number of DMUs be at least twice the number of inputs and outputs combined. the number of DMUs should be at least three times the number of inputs and outputs combined. However, such a rule is neither imperative, nor does it have a statistical basis, but rather is often imposed for convenience.

In summary, DEA is not a form of regression model, but rather it is a frontier based linear programming-based optimization technique. It is meaningless to apply a sample size requirement to DEA, which should be viewed as a benchmarking tool focusing on individual performance. It is likely that a significant portion of DMUs will be deemed as efficient, if there are “too many” inputs and outputs given the number of DMUs. If the goal is to obtain fewer efficient DMUs, then one can use weight restrictions or other DEA approaches to reduce the number of efficient DMUs.

In a “radial” model, a DMU’s efficiency score is derived from the extent to which all of its inputs can be contracted and/or its outputs expanded, where this contraction or expansion occurs proportionately. For example, in the case of a model seeking to reduce inputs, the greatest percentage reduction in all inputs is sought; hence the term “radial”, as the examined input possibilities occur on the line extending radially from the origin of the input space (i.e. zero values for all inputs) to the DMU’s original inputs. For instance, in an input-oriented radial model, a factory might aim to reduce all inputs equally without decreasing its output, while in an output-oriented radial model, it might seek to increase all outputs proportionally without increasing inputs. These models are often referred to as proportional models due to their assumption that inputs and outputs can be adjusted in tandem, maintaining their current ratios. In contrast, non-radial models offer a more flexible approach by allowing for non-proportional changes in inputs and outputs. This means that some inputs can be reduced more than others, or some outputs can be increased while others are decreased, as long as the overall efficiency improves. Non-radial models are particularly useful in real-world scenarios where inputs and outputs may not scale uniformly. They provide a more nuanced assessment of efficiency, acknowledging that different resources and products may have varying degrees of scalability. The choice between radial and non-radial models depends on the specific context and objectives of the analysis. Radial models are simpler and easier to interpret, making them suitable for situations where maintaining the current input or output mix is desirable. However, their restrictive nature may not always reflect the complexities of real-world operations. Non-radial models, while more complex, offer greater flexibility and can provide a more accurate efficiency evaluation by allowing for varied adjustments in inputs and outputs.

The model in DEA can be analyzed in two orientations: input-orientation and output-orientation. The orientation corresponds to the viewpoint taken in improving the inefficient DMUs, whether the goal would be to reduce excess inputs consumed or expand shortfalls in outputs produced, respectively, to move the inefficient DMU to the frontier. Traditionally, DEA models are categorized into input orientation and output orientation. Input orientation focuses on minimizing inputs while maintaining a given level of output, which is beneficial for organizations aiming to reduce costs or resource usage. On the other hand, output orientation emphasizes maximizing outputs for a fixed set of inputs, suitable for entities seeking to enhance production or service delivery. However, there is also a non-oriented or both orientation approach in DEA, which considers improvements in both inputs and outputs simultaneously. This non-radial model provides a more balanced perspective, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of efficiency without prioritizing one aspect over the other. It is particularly useful for organizations that seek to optimize both resource utilization and output generation without bias. The choice of orientation in DEA can significantly impact the efficiency evaluation. Input orientation might be preferred by cost-conscious organizations, while output orientation could be favored by those aiming to increase productivity. Non-oriented models offer a middle ground, enabling a more holistic view of performance.

When discussing how outputs respond to changes in all input levels, the concepts of constant returns to scale (CRS), increasing returns to scale (IRS), decreasing returns to scale (DRS), and variable returns to scale (VRS) become central to understanding the nature of growth. CRS occurs when an organization adjusts every input by a common proportion and observes that output changes by precisely the same proportion. In simpler terms, if every resource is increased by a certain factor and the result is an exactly proportional rise in production, the operation is said to experience CRS. This suggests a balanced relationship between inputs and outputs, where growth in resources translates directly into equivalent growth in production without any gains or losses in efficiency purely from scaling. IRS describes a situation in which scaling up all inputs by a particular factor leads to an even larger proportional increase in output. In practical terms, when resources are expanded in unison, the resulting production grows by a greater proportion than that of the inputs. This usually arises due to factors such as specialization of labor, greater efficiency of larger equipment, or other efficiencies that emerge only once a firm has surpassed a certain size. As a result, organizations may find that operating at a larger scale reduces average costs and boosts productivity beyond what one would expect from a straightforward, one-to-one increase. DRS refers to an outcome where the proportional rise in output is smaller than the proportional increase in inputs. This pattern frequently emerges when firms become too large and encounter challenges such as congestion of resources, bureaucratic delays, or difficulties in coordinating a vast number of tasks. Even though the absolute level of output might continue to rise as more inputs are added, the relative efficiency gains diminish because expanding further introduces inefficiencies that slow the growth of output. VRS encompasses a broader range of possibilities, implying that the relationship between scaling inputs and the resulting output can shift depending on the size of the operation or the stage of growth. This means an organization might enjoy IRS when it is relatively small, transition to CRS at some intermediate level, and eventually experience DRS at a larger size. The term VRS reflects the idea that returns do not adhere to a single pattern across every level of expansion, but rather depend on where the firm stands in its growth trajectory and how effectively it manages the complex issues that arise as size increases. The CRS efficiency score will be less than or equal to the VRS score, and the ratio of CRS/VRS scores gives a measure of the DMU’s scale efficiency, i.e. the effect on its productivity from potentially not operating at the optimal scale. This relationship between CRS and VRS scores holds for all DEA models. The VRS model is frequently applied and can offer useful additional insights to those obtained from a CRS model on the same dataset. When the VRS or CRS model is specified, the reason for choosing one over the other should also be noted. One of the advantages of DEA is that one need not know the functional form, which would include knowing the returns to scale characteristics. There are also cases where a larger unit is less efficient than a smaller unit, and analyzing this situation where there are expected to be increasing returns to scale can overlook the real possibility that the large unit is less efficient due to the way it operates and not due to decreasing returns or any scale affect. Applying both CRS and VRS would help identify the inefficiency in the larger unit.
