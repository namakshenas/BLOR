The production of zinc ingots is a sophisticated metallurgical process that transforms raw zinc concentrate into refined metal through a carefully orchestrated sequence of chemical and physical operations, supported by essential technical and regulatory functions.
The journey begins at the Concentrate Warehouse, where zinc concentrate—the raw material containing zinc sulfide along with various impurities—is received and stored under controlled conditions before entering the production line. This initial storage ensures a steady supply of feedstock and allows for proper inventory management and quality assessment of incoming materials.
From the warehouse, the concentrate moves to the Leaching Unit, where the first major chemical transformation occurs. Here, the zinc concentrate is dissolved in sulfuric acid, converting the zinc sulfide into zinc sulfate solution. This acidic leaching process liberates the zinc from its mineral form and creates an aqueous solution that can be further processed, though it still contains various dissolved impurities alongside the desired zinc sulfate.
The resulting solution then flows to the Refinery Unit, where purification takes place. This critical stage removes unwanted elements such as iron, copper, cadmium, and other metals that would compromise the final product's quality. The Cake Washing Unit, sometimes referred to as the BZS Unit, plays an important supporting role during this refining stage by washing intermediate products—solid residues or "cakes" formed during purification—to recover valuable zinc and remove contaminants that would otherwise reduce efficiency or quality.
Once the zinc sulfate solution has been sufficiently purified, it enters the Electrowinning Unit, where the transformation from dissolved metal to solid zinc occurs. This process relies on substantial electrical energy supplied and regulated by the Transformer Room, which manages the power distribution essential for the electrochemical reactions. In the electrowinning cells, an electric current passes through the purified solution, causing pure zinc to deposit onto aluminum or titanium cathodes while oxygen evolves at the anodes. Over several days, these deposits grow into thick sheets of high-purity zinc metal.
The harvested zinc cathodes are then transported to the Casting Unit, where they are melted in furnaces and cast into standardized ingots. This final production step involves carefully controlling temperature and mold conditions to produce ingots of specific dimensions and weights that meet international trading standards and customer requirements.
Throughout this entire production sequence, the Laboratory and Quality Control unit performs continuous chemical analysis and testing, sampling materials at various stages to verify that the process is operating within specifications and that the final ingots meet the required purity grades, such as Special High Grade (SHG) zinc or other commercial grades denoted by standards like Zn 4 or Zn 3.
The Technical Unit provides the engineering backbone for this operation, ensuring that all machinery, instruments, and process equipment function reliably through preventive maintenance, troubleshooting, and technical improvements. Meanwhile, the Quality, Health, Safety and Environment unit maintains vigilance over worker safety, occupational health, and environmental compliance, managing everything from acid handling protocols and electrical safety to effluent treatment and air emissions control, ensuring that the facility operates responsibly within regulatory frameworks while protecting both personnel and the surrounding environment.
Together, these production and supporting units function as an integrated system, each contributing its specialized role to transform mineral concentrate into refined zinc ingots ready for use in galvanizing, die-casting, brass production, and numerous other industrial applications.
