There are m machines currently operating in a workshop. A new machine needs to be installed, and we want to find its optimal location.
The problem is defined as follows:

- Existing machines are located at coordinates (a_i, b_i) for i = 1, 2, ..., m
- The cost function uses the squared Euclidean distance between the new machine and each existing machine

We need to find the optimal coordinates (x, y) for the new machine.
